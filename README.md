## How to Setup

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** You may need to look up the correct installation method if running Windows or another operating system. These instructions are for Mac running on Apple Silicon using homebrew.

### Step 1: Install Ruby and RVM (Mac)

This is a ruby project, so you'll need to have ruby installed on your machine with the correct version utilized in the project. Using a version manager is recommended.

1. Ruby: Install ruby on your machine
   - `brew install ruby`
2. Install a ruby version manager like `rvm` (or your preferred version manager)
   - `brew install rvm`
3. Install the ruby version specified in the `.ruby-version` file (3.2.2):
   - `rvm install 3.2.2`
4. Set your system ruby to the version specified in the `.ruby-version` file (3.2.2)
   - `rvm use 3.2.2`

### Step 2: Install PostgreSQL

We'll be using PostgreSQL to store the scraped college data, and will need to install it on our machine. If you're having any trouble installing or running postgres through homebrew, you can also download postgres and run the service using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) for Mac.

1. Install PostgreSQL
   - `brew install postgresql`
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is running on your machine
   - `brew services start postgresql`

### Step 3: Setup the Database

We need to setup the database and create the `colleges` table, to store the scraped college data.

<!-- TODO: Add instructions on setting up database environmental variables if needed -->
1. Run `bundle install` to install the gems specified in the `Gemfile`
2. Run `rake db:create` to create the database and test_database (for specs)
3. Run `rake db:migrate` to run migrations (will create the `colleges` table)
4. How to drop (if needed): Run `rake db:drop`

## How to Run the College Crawler script üéâ

After setting up the project, may now execute the college crawler script to scrape the College Board website and populate the database with data.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** This script supports custom arguments: `batch_size` and `dry_run`.

### üß™ Dry run the script

It's highly recommended to run the script with a dry run first, to verify that the script is working as expected.

- To run a dry run, pass in true as the first argument: `rake scrape[true]`

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Run the script and scrape the College Board website

- Simpy run `rake scrape` (or simply `rake`) to crawl the College Board website and populate the database with data. WARNING: Dry run mode is **false** by default!!
  - Dry run mode is false because this script is intended to be executed as it's default behavior.
  - This may take awhile to complete and will populate the database with college data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Run with a custom batch size

- To run a custom batch size, you can pass in your desired value (ex: `100`) like this: `rake scrape[false, 100]`. This would run the script with dry mode off, and a batch size of 100. You may also turn dry mode on via `rake script[true, 100]`
  - Warning: If you choose a batch size that is too large, you may run into errors due to the College Board API rate limiting, or get your IP address banned. Consider using a VPN or proceeding with caution.

### Run the tests (if you wish)

- Run `rake spec` to run the tests for the script and model.
  - You can also use the command `rspec .` to run the tests

## Technologies Used

- Ruby: humancentric language related to SEI's stack, allowing us to write a script to scrape the College Board website for college data.
- Sequel: allows us to interact with the database via an ORM, and gives us the advantages of migrations, validations, and more.
- HTTParty: allows us to make HTTP requests to the College Board API.
- Nokogiri: allows us to parse the HTML response from the College Board API.
- RSpec: allows us to write tests for our script.
- FactoryBot: allows us to create test data for our `College` model.
- Faker: allows us to create realistic test data for our `College` model.
- PostgreSQL: allows us to store the scraped college data in a database that's scalable and can be indexed and searched.
  - TODO: Add more detail why we're using PostgreSQL
- Debug: allows us to add a `binding.break` break point to the code wherever needed.

## Features

// TODO: Add features

- Scrapes all colleges from the College Board website and stores them in `colleges` table
- Progress Bar
- Throttling
- Dry Run
- Debugging
- **TODO:**
  - Error Handling
  - Logging

## Debugging

- The `debug` gem is included in this project, and imported in the Rakefile, so is available to use throughout the project, as long as running the script via the Rake command.
- Add a `binding.break` to the code to add a break point.

## Technical Concerns

// TODO: Add technical concerns

## Improvements

- Retry mechanism? (if error, retry after 5 seconds X number of times?)
- Add automated testing suite to repository that runs on CI/CD pipeline
- Add a frontend to the application to allow users to search for colleges by name, city, state, etc.
- Add a public API to allow users to search for colleges by name, city, state, etc.
